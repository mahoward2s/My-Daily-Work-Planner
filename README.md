# My-Daily-Work-Planner
<!--Description-->
     Do you have a busy schedule and have a lot to keep track of?
     Are you constantly on the go running from meeting to meeting?
     This Daily Work Planner will help you keep track of your schedule.
     You will be able to block out time and set aside periods of time for work, lunch, or other activites.
     That way you will not have to worry about missing another meeting or running late ever again.

     Utilizing moment.js, JavaScript, and local storage I created a daily planner that will allow a 
     user to track what they have planned for their work day.
